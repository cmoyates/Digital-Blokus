Hello Group!
I wanted to make sure that we had a plan for the group iteration 1, so i thought i would assign each of you roles to complete!
We can further discuss or switch around things, but i just wanted to get a start with this...
I was thinking of assigning

Vision Document & Data Dictionary - Matthew Churchill
List of Actors and goals & "Initiate Game" Dressed use case description - Christopher Yates
"Take a Turn" fully dressed use case description & 2 Brief use case descriptions - James Hudson
3 brief case use descriptions & UI Prototype Sketches - Allison McKinlay
Domain Model & Plan for next Iteration - Rehnoma Hassan


If there is any problem with this, let me know and I will be glad to switch things around, or take on more to do myself :)

I will hopefully be looking to get these in before October 1st (except the plan for next iteration), so that way we can check over
each others work and make little edits where needed!
Thank you so much and hope to be peaking with you soon!
